## Introduction
These script provides the name(s) of the agent(s) where the test is running, in addition it provides further details which can be observed in the **output** section in this document. There are two flavors of this script.

1. **agent_to_tests_details.py**: If the test has multiple agents the line is repeated displaying one agent per line.
2. **agent_to_tests_details_one_line.py**: If the test has multiple agents, all of them are consolidated in the same row in column K.

## Requirements
The script uses the following modules, therefore it is required to have these installed beforehand.

- requests
- csv

## How to Use
The script requests the following information:

- Username (e-mail)
- Basic Token
- AID if filtering is required

**Note**: The token is hidden, therefore you will not see anything when typing.

## Output
The script will generate a CSV report named **tests_to_agents_details.csv** in the same directory where the script is hosted. The following figure displays the output generated by **agent_to_tests_details.py**, please note that **Cisco TEST** is repeated 4 times, one line per agent. In the other hand, **agent_to_tests_details_one_line.py** will put all the information in one line, displaying all the agents in column K named **AGENT_NAME**.

## BDB Version
If you prefer to conduct the test online without installing any library, you can execute this report using the [BDB Version - te_agent_test_details_list](https://scripts.cisco.com/ui/use/te_agent_test_details_list). This option is only available internally (Cisco's employees).
